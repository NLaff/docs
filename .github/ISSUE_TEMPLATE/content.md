## ðŸ“– Missing or out-of-date documentation

**Describe the content that is missing or should be up dated**
A clear and concise description of what content is missing, or needs to be updated. Could be a missing guide explaining a concept, a tutorial, or something that is confusing or doesn't work when you tried it.

**Which part of the site would that content live at?**
Where would it go? In the reference docs? About pages? Guides and tutorials?

**What's the type of content?**
Are we talking about a tutorial, a paragraph somewhere or API docs?

**Optional: Proposed information architecture**
If you have ideas on how we should structure the content, tell us!
